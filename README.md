# CanIMarathon

## Overview

This project focuses on building, exploring, and understanding a dataset used to construct a **marathon performance prediction system** and making said model to give accurate results and in later iteration - have a simple web application which gives the user an interface, which which he can enter his running logs and based on them get a prediction of his marathon performance. 

The primary objectives are:

### Iteration 0
- Load training and performance data.
- Perform data analysis to uncover relationships between physiological and physical metrics, training history, and run outcomes.
- Build an **initial regression model** to predict marathon finishing time. 
- Evaluate model
### Iteration 1
- Make improvements based on results of model in previous iteration
- Start application development, integration of final model in it
### Iteration 2
- Final delivery, final version of the project

## Iteration 0

This initial iteration is designed to:
- Evaluate early results.
- Identify any data issues.
- Set a baseline for more advanced modeling in future iterations.
- Understand feature importance in marathon performance.

However, in this iteration, we **do not use any physiological or biometric inputs**. Instead, the focus is on **data derived solely from previous runs**. The goal is to see if consistent training patterns—like **distance, moving time, and pace**—can be reliable predictors of marathon time.
